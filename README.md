Analysis of transactions and detection of fraudulent transactions


Traditional methods of data analysis have long been used to detect fraud. 
They require complex and time-consuming investigations that deal with different domains of knowledge like financial, economics, business practices and law. 
Fraud often consists of many instances or incidents involving repeated transgressions using the same method. 
They can be similar in content and appearance but usually are not identical. 
Fraud that involves cell phones, insurance claims, tax return claims, credit card transactions etc. represent significant problems for governments and businesses, but yet detecting and preventing fraud is not a simple task. 
It is an adaptive crime, so it needs special methods of intelligent data analysis to detect and prevent it. 
These methods exist in the areas of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), Data Mining, Machine Learning and Statistics. 
They offer applicable and successful solutions in different areas of fraud crimes.
